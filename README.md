# ProjectOne
T-SQL for creating initial Data Warehouse or OLTP database on a Microsoft SQL Server instance.
The following files optionally create the database, files and filegroups. 
Once file and filegroups are in place, the scripts drop and create all database objects.
If the @TabulaRasa bit variable is set to 1 in the DDL.sql script, then the entire database is dropped and recreated. Otherwise, the database, fil and filegroups are left in place, but all other objects below that are dropped and then recreated.
The scripts should be executed in the following order:
  DDL.sql - Data definition language - tables, triggers, materialized views.
  DRI.sql - Declarative referential integrity - foreign key constraints.
  Programmability.sql - stored procedures, functions, assemblies, et al
  DML.sql - Data manipulation language - Initial seeding of tables
